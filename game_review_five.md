### Rating

I give this turn based game a solid 9/10

## Summary

Slay the Spire is about what it is. Climbing up a tower to slay it.
The mechanics overall are fairly simple to explain, but that is also why I've had so much fun with it.
Its a turn based card game, where you have up to 4 characters to select with their own starting decks.
It begans to stand out when you play the other characters (once you unlock them, fairly easy. Just play one round of the previous).
Every character has cards that only can be used by them. So if you play the Ironclad, cards relating to him will only appear. Vise verse with the other 3.

(I'm gonna list the main things, as they all connect together in their own way)
There's three stages I could phrase it. All with different enemy, item, encounter, and boss pools.
After every battle, you may select a new card to add to your deck.
There's shops to buy cards and other items
The other items being relics (basically effects to the player/enemys), potions (one time use that helps the player in a variety of ways), and an option to remove cards.
There's even white cards that EVERY character can use no matter who. Just have to buy it or get lucky.

There's quite a bit to it, as the more you play the more you unlock.
If you manage to beat a run, you unlock modifiers to make future runs more difficult. (However, only avalible for the character you own with.)
If you beat a run with the three main characters (fourth was added much later), some final new mechanics are introduced, as well as a fourth and final level.
Yeah, its a lot of unlocking for awhile but man. Get a good build once and you're hooked until you get another, then another. Aaaand 100 hours are gone.


## Final Thoughts

Slay the Spire is overall a game I very much enjoy, even today.
To tell you the truth I never fully beat the game yet, I get close but not enough.
I don't care though, that's how much I enjoy this game and highly recommend it as a pass time sort of thing.
Theres so much to experience and try out in it, it'll be hours before you discovered even half. (I still new about 4 more things. Yeah, still unlocking stuff after 96.4 hours)
There's also a steam workshop, you can imagine the dedicated modding communities out there adding even more.
Why 9/10? Minus one point because my luck is terrible and it can be annoying. That's it though. So 10/10 really.
