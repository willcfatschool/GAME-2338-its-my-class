# Game Review for Halo Infinite (Multiplayer Beta)

## Details

### Game Title

Halo Infinite, but I got to play the multiplayer beta!

### Rating

9/10 (On Console)

## Summary

Since this was just the multiplayer, I only thought about how it'd compare to Halo: MCC.
On the main menus, theres plenty of different tabs. Though it feels like any old battle royale game.
You have the shop, where you could buy cosmetics and even the battle pass. (Note: We were gifted a heck of a lot of ingame currency, Both for the battlepass and everything in the shop)
Theres the part of the menus where you equip armor, colors, weapons and vehicles. There even was A.I. friends, 4 different ones to choose some.
I swear one sounded like Robin (Teen Titans), another reminded me of GLADOS.

First main difference was a training grounds. One with just you and bots where you experiment and have fun.
Another solely for training with new weapons. I got to see a few new ones, and man if the right player has them I'm screwed.
Anywho, each has its own tier of training with a high score mechanic. You have 30 seconds in every one of them.
Overall it was good to introduce the new weapons, sadly not vehicles.

As for the main multiplayer, there was three modes.
Arena, Social, and Vs. Bots. I got to do at least two rounds on all.
Arena is was set as Big Team Battle, really fun. Its where some of the new things like the Wasp and A.I useage was found.
The wasp is a fast and stupidly powerful air unit. The cost is that it is also stupidly weak.
As for the A.I's, theres one cool thing I've found they can do. Some doors are locked and they can hack it open. It wasn't much but it opens very cool opportunities for more gamemodes/custom games.
Finally the gears, that's what I called them. Like in all of the series there was invisibility, drop shield. Infinite introduces the grapple hook.
ITS FUN TO USE, I HATE THE LIMITED USES BUT I UNDERSTAND.
Also, invisibility is useful now. You cannot see someone if they're invisible, run. Or just pay attention to the radar I think.

Very lastly and short paragraph.
Social games was just 4v4 swat and all that fun stuff. Normal and fun showing new maps.
Vs. Bots was a bit of the same. That's really it.

## Final Thoughts

What a good beta this was! I cannot wait to get back into playing with my friends on halo again. I miss those days.
With Multiplayer being free, 343 so far is showing great promise.
My only issue was that it ran with badly less frames on my old Xbox One (But overall well!)
My friend came by with his Xbox One S, and it ran much better. (Hey, I remember this testing...uh...portability right?)
Overall, great beta. I need forge now.

## Additional Information

Halo Insider, Halo Twitter (for info about betas mostly).
Theres also a lot of videos showcasing many new things Infinite has. If I can find the channel I'll edit and add this here. I can't wait for this to release, 343 is nice with multiplayer.
