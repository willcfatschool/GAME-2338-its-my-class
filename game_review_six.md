### Rating

For gameplay, I give it a solid 7/10
For community, I give it a -2/10
I'll be mainly focusing on the gameplay though.

## Summary

This game is exactly like League of Legends, like its really the exact same thing.
I'm writing about it because I've played it a lot for some reason when I was younger. I understand it better.
DOTA 2 classicaly plays like LoL, so its the usual 5v5 until one side destroys the others base.
Minions spawn on three lanes and its up to the players and teams to organize themselves.

From what I remember there the hero types were Support, Tanks, and Magic.
I mainly played support, so all my time would be building my characters abilities and keeping my allies out of trouble.
Tanks would mostly watch the lanes and level up as quick as possible.
Magic people would be a mix of both, their skill sets are a tad different however.

Though I'm jumping too quick, besides the three types every character has their quirks. 
Theres a max level so aiming for it every round was key, and as quickly as possible.
You could also get a huge variety of items, there was plenty of set ups you could make with any character.
Even some character specific items I believe.

There's also the forest, the filler of the map with enemies that give decent gold/exp to those that killed it.
This is what support would do because they would die almost instantly when alone and encountered.
All in all this game is mainly about having a good plan, and getting used to your prefered character.
Its fun if you love to cooperate with others and have a good time with strategy games.

They also have custom modes so you can play against bots of course, and even player made custom games.
So if you're bored with the main game, feel free to explore the dozens of custom games in that market.

## Final Thoughts

I last played this years ago, but I still remember it fondly because it was fun for awhile.
I played with some online friends, I sucked pretty badly at it but they didn't care, and that's where the most fun came from it.
Of course we got bored of it, but besides that DOTA really wasn't that bad if you played with the right people.
The overall community is what drove me away from it, jesus that and LoL are the same.
If you can just mute or tolerate the people then you have some insanely great mental strength.
Otherwise its a fun game to play, but not fun to play with people, despite that's what it was made for.
This was a more personal review, but the community points still stand today.
