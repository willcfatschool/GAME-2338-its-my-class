### Rating

I give this tile based game a solid 10/10

## Summary

(I'll be refering the game to NecroDancer, easier to type)

This game story wise is about a girl named Cadence on a personal quest to get a Golden Lute.
Upon her decent into the Crypt she was cursed by the NecroDancer himself, causing the main game mechanic to reveal itself.

The game plays as any typical rougelike, with unlocking items and things every run. Hoping for that one good run.
Expect now there's rhythm to it. Every single move you make must be on beat with the song, which does take some time to get used to.
But the charming music makes it easy to follow (at least personally, writing about this brings back painful memories :) ).
It follows a gridbased movement (or tile based for this assignment), so there isn't too much to worry about besides the random generation of the map.

Cadance being the main character we play as, has average stats starting off and shows the player a few things.
For one, one heart is two hits. She starts with 3 full hearts, meaning that theres 6 hit points for the player. Enemies can hit for up to two full hearts (from what I remember).
Though most hit for half or a full heart.
There's also gold, enemies drop gold among other random chance sources.
Items are includes, the pools of such are:

Rings (Random bonus effects for the player)
Armor (Various Damage reduction plus a modifier if it includes one)
Feet (Some bonuses buit mainly enviormental protection)
Torches (Player can see farther)
Shovel (Strength of the shovel)
Magic (Spells that help the player in certain situations.)
Overall random items (Healing/bonus damage/etc)
There's also bombs, but just normal bombs that explode in a 3x3 radius.

As the player does more runs, they can get Diamonds which permanently unlock more items and health upgrades to Cadence only.
Overall, the replayability on items does last many many hours. Its a matter if the player gets tired of keeping a rhythm.
So how does the game look? Where?
There are 5 zones in the game, with three stages in them following a boss.
The player starts off with a few items. A dagger for one damage, a shovel to dig around basic dirt, and one bomb.
Its not much, but once the player gets a hang of it the skill gap dwindles quickly. Its something anyone can pick up.
Main thing though, play fast, as once the song is over you're forced to the next level. You'll notice when the notes turn red.

## Final Thoughts

Crypt of the NecroDancer is an older, but very fun game to play and come back to even today.
I had completely forgotten about it until looking up tile based games on steam.
It's a great and old rougelike that'll keep you entertained for a good while.
I had no real gameplay issues with it, of course I cannot beat the one hit and your dead mode, but I can always try someday.
The only real issues I had was with the audio, funny enough. I'm not sure why this happens entirely, but from some testing with my computer and a friends,
if you launch the game with too many things open in the background; the audio distorts like hell. Play the game with almost nothing else open for this issue to not show.
Otherwise, good game. Will kept listening to the shopkeeper sing with the songs.

Small update: If you're having audio suttery issues, the following solution works (from the FAQ page)

"I get a weird stuttery audio problem on Windows.

Navigate to the game’s Steam install folder and open the audio.txt file. Try editing it to change the numbers from “1024 2 0 0” to “1024 4 0 0” or “1024 4 -1 0” or “1024 4 -1 1”. (Try the first set of numbers first, then run the game. If that doesn’t help, try the second set, etc.) Make sure that each of these four numbers is on its own line in the text file."
