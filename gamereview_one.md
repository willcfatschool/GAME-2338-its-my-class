### Rating

This is currently a 5/5 star rating game for me.

## Summary
I'll dedicate each paragraph to something different

Deltarune is Toby's version of a different view of Undertale. Imagine if Undertale was a draft of an essay, and deltarune became the finished story.
Except the entire story is now different and Toby published a different first draft. Still cool though.
Undertale's story element the power of choice that players have, mainly in the style of battle of killing and mercy in an RPG fashion.
Deltarune's story element is sort of similar, however is compeltely opposite as killing is almost impossible. You're told in the beginning that *you* yourself have no choice in that world.
Its freaky, but it makes sense by the time chapter 1 is over. Best way I can put that without any spoilers.

The mechanics of the game do play similary to Undertale too, expect the main aspect of it changes.
The main fighting and dodging is the same, being a red heart running around avoiding various bullet hells.
A difference in Deltarune now allow you to fight as a party of up to three this time.
Mainly though, the party members are always the same for these two chapters. Kris (You?), Susie, And Ralsei.
Everyone and everything follows the RPG element too, now with slow level ups, armor and weapons to equip, and a currency that quickly goes away buying healing items.
It plays like a fun RPG as well as a story, its great with a lot more to see and do.

Here, I'll talk about the setting. Theres two different ones going on.
One is refered to as the "Light Realm", where it mostly plays and feels like Undertale.
The second is the "Dark Realm", which is where an entire new style and everything hits you at once.
Its like a surprise to the player with a whole new experience, while keeping the old charms and continuing them.
Toby got both worlds to work together, and even make a lot of sense in Chapter 2 (Thank god its explained more there).
Overall, both worlds have aspects. With the Darkworld being more complicated RPG driven, and the Lightworld being more story driven

(spoiler paragraph)
Going on a little more with the story, as the end of chapter one leaves a cliffhanger of a theme that I'd call "anti-choice"
Remember how I said Deltarune is the opposite of Undertale? It plays a lot all over. Many times where when about to make a choice, the game strips it away and goes on.
Chapter one follows this, but chapter 2 introduces more information and a horrifying realization. But I won't write about that as it'd take too long.
To give some context but not insanely big spoilers. Its established that You and the Character you're playing as are two different characters.
Its like this, you're the puppet master, and Kris is your puppet. Most of the time at least.
It sounds messed up, but if you wish to look up the endings. It explains itself.

## Final Thoughts

I enjoyed Deltarune a lot, and while I gave it a perfect score there always is some things I would note and be concerned with.
My concerns first, being that with the amount of content that Chapter 2 had. I worry that connecting it to future chapters would be insanely difficult.
Theres so much going on that the game remembering everything you did is already about twice or more than what Undertale did. (For example, think Detroit: Become Human. That game was cool but the quality of choices fell drasticly very quickly when you really read into context)
Another concern is how the engine is. I've had a couple of crashes just interacting with a shop or NPC.
As well, the SAVE FILES are something else too. You have 3 slots, however its more like 3x7. In both chapters, you can have three save files for each.
I might imagine Toby might have 3 slots for every chapter, or change it to just 3 classic ones. I worry that it might cause a failure somewhere. Corruption or something like that.

Okay, besides my concerns. This is an amazing experience that I would recommend anyone. Its free to play the first two chapters and theres enough content to play over a couple of days.
The character development is fun to watch, the gameplay is more engaging and rewarding. Theres so many pluses and charms that it holds. I love this style of game.
Music is absoulely wonderful too. I wonder how many songs there will be once all 7 chapters are released.
Anyways, long story short. Deltarune is an engaging story that continues the playstyle of Undertale. While holding all the charms it had.
The battles keep getting better, the music keeps you listening, and the story keeps you on your toes. (Though holy cow is he good with cliffhangers.)

## Additional Information

deltarune.com for downloads for the game plus some info from Toby Himself about the progress of the game.
Hes currently aiming for the release of Chapters 3-5 being released at the same time. I will not sleep that day, haha.
Chapter 1 was almost 100% made by him, but chapter 2 took 3 years due to game engine desisions, personal health, and making a team for it. Thankfully that hard process is mostly over for him (as he states in the latest dev log).
