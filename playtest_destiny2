**Question:** During your playtesting where the rules of the game understandable? If not, what was not clear.
> _Answer:_ Its fairly simple to understand and get used too. Theres an entire "new light" campaign that teaches new players what to do and expect from the game.
From the gunplay, mods, armor, rareities, gametypes, and even enemy types. It takes its time to get the player completely used to the game.

**Question:** During gameplay did you notice anything that shouldn't be in the game or could be removed and it wouldn't effect game play?
> _Answer:_ Its hard to find something it remove that wouldn't change the game. As if I were to remove anything it'd make the game a bit easier to play, funny enough.
You could remove the Champion mods and it'd entirely be focused around just killing tanky enemies.
Or remove the power cap and everything is equal in terms of play fields. Which allows everyone to do everything fairly.
Destiny 2 is set up in such a way to force a long grind, which understandably doesn't work with some people. If one aspect was removed it'd be weird.

**Question:** Is this game balanced? If not, what is the target audience for this game based on that imbalance?
> _Answer:_ It is and then it isn't. The balanced parts are the power levels as its much easier to get on track for it.
It keeps its balance by having slow and steady progression with the power of armors and weapons. Areas locked by certain power levels.
The farther you go, the more and higher requirements. So the progression is balanced in its definition.

**Question:** Does the timing of this game appear to be about right for this type of game?
> _Answer:_ Yes, its the type of game that'll last for a good couple of more years. Though of course it'll have to change story or gameplay wise at some point.
Nothing drastic, but it'll need to happen. As the story it tell follows the same overall gameplay. Its already getting noted to be a bit boring and repetitive.
Though they already said they're going to rebalance/redo the subclasses, which already shows some unbalance on their end. Its a mess I don't want to get into too much
as it all falls on the same thing. Its fun for sure! But really needs the background work.

**Question:** During gameplay did the mechanics and theme go together and reinforce each other?
> _Answer:_ The mechanics do work together, even reinforcing it too. Its a process of learning that goes like this.
Players learn guns and armor, along with power levels first.
Move on to missions and mods and even champions. Tells the player how to understand and deal with greater threats.
Then it introduces Dungeons, where it wants you to bring two friends and enjoy a long (raid like) mission.
It introduces more and more slowly and steadily to let the player get used to it. Like riding a bike expect you give the rider ungodly powers in the form of more training wheels,
then shove them off once the New Light missions are over.

**Question:** Did you have fun playing this game?
> _Answer:_ I did, in fact I've been playing on and off recently to do the story content for the season. Though this has been a more boring (personally) season.
Its too long, and the content currently is getting very repetitive. But that's the nature of this game and when you play it for so long it does that.
Not saying its 100% boring, but after doing it for so long its getting there. Still can be very fun for new players however.

**Question:** During gameplay what problems or issues seemed to happen and how did you get them to reoccur?
> _Answer:_ Its been patched already funny enough but theres a gun called "Telesto", somehow this thing breaks all the time. Its basically like a sticky gernade launcher but VERY fast.
What happened is that if you shot it on a teammate, they became invincible. Basically god mode was enabled just by having then stuck on them. So imagine how PvP mode was for awhile.
They did nicely allow it in PvE though till it was patched, it was a good time to grind (since you couldn't lose).
