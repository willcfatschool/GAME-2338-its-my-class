**Question:** During your playtesting where the rules of the game understandable? If not, what was not clear.
> _Answer:_ Its fairly simple to understand and get used too. Theres an entire "new light" campaign that teaches new players what to do and expect from the game.
From the gunplay, mods, armor, rareities, gametypes, and even enemy types. It takes its time to get the player completely used to the game.

**Question:** During gameplay did you notice anything that shouldn't be in the game or could be removed and it wouldn't effect game play?
> _Answer:_ Bungie marketing teams s

**Question:** Is this game balanced? If not, what is the target audience for this game based on that imbalance?
> _Answer:_ It is and then it isn't. The balanced parts are the power levels as its much easier to get on track for it.

**Question:** Does the timing of this game appear to be about right for this type of game?
> _Answer:_ Yes, its the type of game that'll last for a good couple of more years. Though of course it'll have to change story or gameplay wise at some point.
Nothing drastic, but it'll need to happen.

**Question:** During gameplay did the mechanics and theme go together and reinforce each other?
> _Answer:_ Your answer here

**Question:** Did you have fun playing this game?
> _Answer:_ I did, in fact I've been playing on and off recently to do the story content for the season. Though this has been a more boring (personally) season.
Its too long, and the content currently is getting very repetitive. But that's the nature of this game and when you play it for so long it does that.
Not saying its 100% boring, but after doing it for so long its getting there. Still can be very fun for new players however.

**Question:** During gameplay what problems or issues seemed to happen and how did you get them to reoccur?
> _Answer:_ Its been patched already funny enough but theres a gun called "Telesto", somehow this thing breaks all the time. Its basically like a sticky gernade launcher but VERY fast.
What happened is that if you shot it on a teammate, they became invincible. Basically god mode was enabled just by having then stuck on them. So imagine how PvP mode was for awhile.
They did nicely allow it in PvE though till it was patched, it was a good time to grind (since you couldn't lose).
