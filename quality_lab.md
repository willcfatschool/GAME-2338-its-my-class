## Favorite Games among group and why

## Game 1: Destiny 2 (My favorite!)
Besides personally enjoying the games story and how it plays (sort of lol). 
Destiny 2 has a lot going on inside it, and I'm surprised of how much better its doing now with all the time sets they have given themselves.
I believe its a good quality game because of the replayability and constant little updates every week.
As it does the community and developers seem to be getting in a better relationship, as bug reports and issues are very quickly noted. Heck, even the developers will lay out bugs found before a new update. Don't get why people are so upset about it.
Destiny 2 definitely has and constantly gets the funds for so much opportunity, and thankfully the results are currently doing great!

## Game 2: Apex Legends 
For a battle royale game it has pretty interesting support.
Although the company itself is going through some things (titanfall 2 servers), the quality of Apex due to the support from the players/testing has also done well.
For me its a bit similar of the same thing to D2, a company has learned from plenty of early mistakes during production. And with battle royales, I'm sure the balancing team had a great time working on that.


## Game 3: Dying Light=
I only really watched Dying Light playthroughs, allthough from first impressions on reviews and gameplay. I'm impressed.
For it being open world and relying on many (I guess I can say) RPG factors, its fun and reminds me of Dead Island.
Anyways, for any game like this you could expect the testing to be IMMENSE. Like probably absolutely crazy no matter the scale. I imagine there would have to be so much written and the data analysis will be something else.
From watching a bit of the longplay, results seem well! There's a lot to take in this post apocalyptic world.
The desired elements for zombies, RPG, and open world are there. And the steady story keep it interesting throughout the game. Though I sort of wish I played it so I got a better understanding, cool reccommedation from my classmates though!
