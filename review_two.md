## Summary

I love games like this, sort of just building a colony and seeing how far I can get. Or more of the battle side (Imagine Halo Wars for example).

They are Billions combines the complicated base building with a mix of a constant threat from zombies.
Theres two main modes, a freeplay mode where you set some rules for a goal and survive or don't. And the other being the story mode.
Story mode also has some unique levels in it. But imagine the story being building a bunch of colonies to reclaim land from zombies.
Its big thing is how many zombies there are, hence the "Billions" part of it. Of course no one could handle billions (or a computer at that point).
Though the game does challenge the player on efficiency of base building and combat. Its fun but can get overwhelming for new players (understandably though).

So the base building plays out like this;
You start with the town hall, enough supplies to began the colony, and a few troops to defend in the beginning.
You are also surronded by zombies in every direction. So that's where all the troops go for the beginning of the round usually.
But to get anything, you need people. Its like this; Homes make people - people work or become troops - resources consumed - cycle repeats.
Of course there is upgrading the homes, and getting better ways of defense and getting resources.

The real insane challenge is being forced to deal with a hoard of zombies every two in-game weeks.
It starts simple enough, but one run and you'll see just how fast the game goes. Many mistakes can destroy your colony, I've lost plenty because I wasn't paying attention and one zombie slipped through.
The more hoards the come, the more zombies spawn not only from there. But multiple hoards from multiple directions at the same time.
It becomes a game of planning where to expand and upgrade during those two week break from hoards of zombies.
The final hoard is the worst. Of course it depends on the difficultly and all those modifiers. But potentally hundreds of thousands of zombies will spawn to put you on the ultimate test.
I love it, its really fun!

The story mode also introduces some "hero" levels. Which is just your main guy/girl with maybe some troops travelling through a location. Its as simple as that.

## Final Thoughts

Like I said I really love this type of game and had a lot of fun with doing my best with it. Though it just gets too difficult too quickly.
Theres no decent tutorial on some specifics, like most of the commands of your troops, or the purpose of some troops/buildings. Its just how to click a few things and in you go.
I think a tutorial level or two would've been much better. But I could just be that bad. It needs to give newer players more time to enjoy the game.
Also, the game was sort of just realeased and not much was added. Theres huge potental and people would try to talk to the developers, but currently it seems its a finished/unfinished game.
I'd like more games like this in todays age, I remember playing so many of these when I was younger with my dad. Hope to see more in the future. :)

Mainly steam reviews (the long ones), as most reviews on YouTube are not that but base building strats.
